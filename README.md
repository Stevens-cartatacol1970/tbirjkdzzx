Oh man, just rolled out of the theater after Squad 36 and wow, brain still buzzing like a fridge—where do I even start? The popcorn's gone stale in my lap and this bench isn’t doing my back any favors, you know how it is. Still thinking about that scene with the, with the explosions and the guy, what was his name? Greg or Craig? Doesn’t matter, he had that look, like he’d rather eat soup with a fork than be in the firefight. 

It’s like, they really pulled you in with those first five minutes, bam, right there. And then, that soundtrack! Like if Metallica had a baby with a thunderstorm. Oof. My ears are still ringing but in a good way? It’s like somebody dumped a bag of marbles in my brain and shook it up, all clattering around but in a kinda beautiful chaos. 

> There was that part, you know, in the desert, sand and bullets like it’s a Spaghetti Western but with laser guns instead of revolvers. I mean, they don’t actually show you laser guns, but it felt like that vibe, like Clint Eastwooding through a post-apocalyptic wasteland, only wearing too much leather and with way cooler helmets. It was like they’d 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed Mad Max and just cranked the volume all the way up.

Anyway, I think you asked if you should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   but honestly, you just gotta see it to believe it. Remember that scene when the lead chick, Sarah, does that insane motorcycle thing—like Evel Knievel but on Mars or something? Yeah, the whole theater was just, you know, collectively holding a breath like we’d all sipped the same scary smoothie.

Actually, no don’t think you could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 that gut punch of a twist at the end though, like it plugged straight into your brain and rewrote the bits that understand what's real. Left the theater and it was like the whole world had shuffled a step to the right.

Why’s this text covered in popcorn crumbs? Ew. My bad. Anyway, gotta process this, or maybe re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it once my ears stop ringing. Gotta be ready for when someone asks—wait, forgot who even asked, maybe it was you? Doesn’t matter.
